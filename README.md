## Requirements
For this project, we will be building out a React application that displays a list of Battle Bots and an army of the same, among other features.
The instructions section walks you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

## Project Guidelines
The project should conform to the following set of guidelines: Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you
can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web
developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through
a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

## Instructions
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right
places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

*Create a new project folder.
*Create a new GitHub repository.
*Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading         purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
*Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.
*In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this data Links to an external site.for your server DB.
*Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json
*Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/bots
 
### Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

## Endpoints for Core Deliverables
#### GET /bots
Example Response:

```json
[
  {

    "armor": 63,
    "bot_class": "Support",
    "catchphrase": "1010010101001101100011000111101",

    "updated_at": "2018-10-02T19:55:10.827Z"
  }
]
```

#### DELETE /bots/:id
Example Response:

```json
{}
```

### Bonus Deliverables
These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working project, and commit all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could
  look like the following:

- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this data Links to an external site.for your server DB.

* Run this command to get the backend started: <code>json-server --watch db.json</code>
* Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/transactions/.
 

## Project Setup
To access this project on you local computer, follow the steps below;

* Open your terminal
* Clone this repository: 
    - Run <code>git clone (git@github.com:prince475/week -1-code-challenge-flatiron-bank.git)</code>


### Installations:
* Open a new terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to clone the project from.

* Clone the project in your prefered directory and navigate to the root folder of the project.

* Run <code>npm install</code> in the root directory of the cloned project. 

* Run <code>npm install create-react-app</code> on the terminal.

* Run <code>npm install -g npm</code> This will make sure you have the newest version of npm. Once this is installed, you should be able to run the npx command.

* Open Visual Studio Code:
    - Run <code>code .</code> .

* Click on the available files to view the codes used

* Open terminal in your vscode and run <code>npm install</code> .

* Also in the terminal run <code>npm start</code> to start the project.




### Access
To access the content on the browser:

* click on this depolyed link (https://week-2-code-challenge-bot-battlr.vercel.app/) to render the project on a browser.

* Run <code>npm start</code> on your terminal to start the backend json server
   * (This enables the user to view the rendered UI with the fetched list of bank transactions from a deployed db.json on vercel)

   * or
   
   * Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser by running json-server --watch db.json form terminal.


* NOTE!!! The data in the db.json is not persistent you have to refresh the page every time you add or delete an item to see the updated UI.
